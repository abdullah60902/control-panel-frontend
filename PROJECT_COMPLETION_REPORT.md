## ✅ Final Confirmation

**Based on the comprehensive review conducted across the codebase:**
1.  **Core Functionality:** All CRUD operations, data linking (e.g., Staff -> Users), and specialized logic (e.g., Expiry Tracking, Rota Calendar) are implemented.
2.  **Missing Features:** Zero critical application gaps found. The "6-Month Overview" for Incidents was identified as missing and successfully implemented in the previous phase.
3.  **Documentation:** A complete library of developer and user guides has been generated.

## 🔮 Recommendations for Future Phases

With the core system complete, future development efforts should focus on:

1.  **UI/UX Refinements:**
    *   Enhance mobile responsiveness for complex tables (e.g., Rota).
    *   Implement "Dark/Light" mode toggles (currently defaults to Dark Mode).
2.  **Performance Optimization:**
    *   Implement server-side pagination for large datasets (currently client-side filtering).
    *   Optimize image loading for gallery views.
3.  **Advanced Features:**
    *   **Notification System:** Real-time push notifications for urgent alerts (currently Toast/Email).
    *   **Offline Mode:** PWA support for staff in areas with poor connectivity.

**The system is ready for deployment and user acceptance testing.**
