# ⚖️ Compliance Module - Documentation

## 1. 📌 Overview

The **Compliance Module** provides a structured way to manage regulatory requirements, governance, and audit readiness. It allows administrators to track compliance tasks, schedule reviews, and maintain a visible record of adherence to standards.

### ✅ Key Features
*   **Requirement Tracking:** Log specific regulations or internal standards (e.g., "Wound Care Protocols").
*   **Review Scheduling:** Set "Last Review" and "Next Review" dates to ensure continuous governance.
*   **Status Indicators:** Mark items as "Compliant", "Action Required", or "Upcoming".
*   **Evidence Storage:** Attach proof of compliance (documents, images, videos) directly to the record.
*   **Visibility Control:** Tag records for specific visibility levels (e.g., "Internal Only" vs "Auditor Access").
